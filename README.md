Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a Lung Cancer Detection System using machine learning. The system is designed to predict the presence of lung cancer based on patient data and X-ray images. It employs various classification algorithms to provide accurate predictions that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalization, and feature selection.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest for classification.
Model Evaluation: Comparison of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC curve.
Deployment: Model deployment using Flask to create a web-based interface for predictions.
Visualization: Data visualization to understand the distribution and relationships of features.
