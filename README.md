# Lung-cancer
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning-based lung cancer detection system. The project leverages various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest, to predict the presence of lung cancer based on patient data and X-ray images.
